# The Explorer frontend

***Source code: https://github.com/guts-consortium/guts-explorer***

The GUTS explorer frontend uses [VueJS 3](https://vuejs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com), and standard JavaScript functionality. It is the web-based interface through which users can:
- register / login via SRAM
- browse metadata of the GUTS project, and add items to their basket
- check out their "data basket", i.e. request data access

Its build process is managed by [Vite](https://vite.dev/)
